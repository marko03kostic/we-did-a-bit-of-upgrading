# We Did A Bit of Upgrading 🏙️✨

Welcome to **We Did A Bit of Upgrading**, the game that perfectly captures the *charm* of building upgrades in Serbia. Because who doesn’t love the idea of *just adding one more floor* to that old building right next to your window? 🙃 In a world where the housing bubble is growing faster than your *"impressive"* stack of illegal floors, everything's fine — totally fine. What's a little bit of extra construction in a city that’s already teetering on the edge of absurdity?

In this game, you’ll be navigating the world of urban chaos, where more is always better – especially if you can’t see the sun anymore due to that shiny new high-rise you’re putting on top. What’s a little corruption between friends, right?
